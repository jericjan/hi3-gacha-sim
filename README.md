# hi3-gacha-sim
Simple gacha simulator for Hi3

Runs a simulation of Honkai Impact 3 gacha pulls for both expansion supply and focused supply banners.
From the simulations, it's shown that the average player will get the UP valyrie in 50 pulls and all of the gear (including wishing well) in 90 pulls, for a total of 140 pulls or 39,200 crystals.
Not exactly new information, I know, but I wanted to try something.
